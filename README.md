# Strava Running Analysis — Applied Sport Science Project

## Overview

This project applies **sport science principles** and **data analytics** to improve running pace
using personal Strava data.  
The focus is on **aerobic efficiency (MAF training)** during injury recovery, followed by
performance translation in later phases.

The project is designed as a **longitudinal analysis**, combining:

- Training theory (aerobic base, progressive overload)
- Wearable data (pace, heart rate, cadence)
- Python-based data analysis

---

## Objectives

- Improve running pace in a **measurable and injury-safe** manner
- Quantify aerobic efficiency improvements using fixed heart rate analysis
- Apply sport science concepts through real-world data
- Build a clean, reusable analytics pipeline

---

## Training Context

- Returning from **IT Band Syndrome**
- Training block dominated by **MAF / easy runs**
- Progressive volume increase (+10 minutes per week, single session)
- 4 runs per week

---

## Key Metrics

- Pace at fixed heart rate (MAF HR)
- Heart rate drift
- Weekly training volume (minutes)
- Cadence trends
- Pain score (qualitative)
